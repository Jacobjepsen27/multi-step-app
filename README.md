## Coding challenge from [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ)

I have used the following libraries to solve this:
- Next.js 13
- React 18
- Xstate (finite state machine))
- PandaCSS
- React Hook Form

The application is fully responsive and accessible.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
